I did my undergraduate degree in computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science with a minor in Russian Studies. Following that, I was a part of CMU's first-ever integrated comp bio master's degree cohort. Also, I played collegiate soccer for CMU as a midfielder.

In the past, I interned at Amazon Web Services in Seattle, played semi-pro soccer in the NPSL, and interned at PostEra. 

Now, I'm working full-time as a software engineer at PostEra to help speed up new medicines for patients.

Outside of work and school, I love to play volleyball, beach soccer, and footvolley.
